#Greet
The greet function should be able to greet an inputed string and return "Hello, {string}" back to the user.  However, if the user inputs another value that is not a string, it should return null to the user.

#Artihmetic
There are two functions for the arithmetic module; add and sub.  

#Add
The add method expects 2 numbers as its parameters to add together and return to total sum of the two.  If either parameter is not a number, the add function should return null.

#Sub
The sub method is the same behavior as the add method, but will subtract the two instead and return the remainder.  It should return null if either parameter is not a number.
